# LUCA Frontend Developer Assessment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.

## Run the project

There are two ways: json-server or Django server

## Run with Django:

You must install this Django project:

https://github.com/meolivares06/community-backend.git`

With Django project running on port 8000 you must run inside this project root folder:

`npm install` then `ng serve`

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`


## json-server way
`note` In this version there is not sorting by creation date, therefore the NUEVOS options don't work as intended.

There is a file named `questions-mock.json` inside the `data` folder of this project.
Example:
`json-server --watch questions-mock.json --port 8000`

Example B:
`json-server --watch data/questions-mock.json --port 8000`


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
